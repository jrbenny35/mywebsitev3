            I would consider myself a junkie. Not the kind to get in trouble with the law, but one that loves seeing things broken down and raw. Nothing is better to me than seeing the guts of a V12 Formula 1 engine, the raw steel that forms a skyscraper,
            or the simple words in a document of my next million dollar Java class! Yes, I am a fiend for design and engineering!

            Being someone who is always willing to learn something new is key. I feel it is key in any industry. I love learning. Nothing is better than going home at the end of the day, knowing you're smarter than you were when you awoke. Applying this knowledge
            is also a skill. As the saying goes, "​In one ear and out the other"​, is not a good attribute to have, so I make sure to be the complete opposite.

            I don't have much working experience but I have a passion for code. I am a quick learner and I love working with my hands. Now I would not call myself a complete newbie, but I would say that I have a firm understanding of most concepts and I can pickup new ones quickly.
            I love technology and seeing how this industry gets better almost every month. There is nothing I would like more than to be apart of this ever-forward moving environment, and do my part to help it along the way!
